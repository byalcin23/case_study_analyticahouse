Used tech-stack :
* requests
* BeautifulSoup
* lxml 
* googleapiclient.discovery 
* google.oauth2 

A brief description of the challenges I face.
* Writing data with google API, the tricky part is getting access to the google cloud platform. because you need to create a payment option. :)

What did you learn from this project?
* I haven't used the lxml library to search xpath before.

Additional Questions
 *Questions 1 : In such cases, duplication and simultaneous execution of running scripts can speed up the process. 
  In addition, an uninterrupted and multi-structured architecture will be easier with the docker architecture for such operations.
  
 *Questions 2 : There are many methods that may vary depending on the environment in which the scripts are run. 
  For example, if the scripts are running in windows environment, task scheduler can be used. Or we can write ourselves a task scheduler using python.
 
 *Questions 3 : API is the easiest method of communication between applications. There are certain rules in the API working logic. 
  API interprets requests from another application according to its own rules and returns a response. Simply, this is how it works.
